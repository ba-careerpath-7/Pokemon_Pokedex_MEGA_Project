# Pokemon_Pokedex_MEGA_Project


### Pokemon Pokedex MEGA Project from Resume

## Overview:
This project explores Pokemon data using Python and machine learning. The goal is to clean the pokedex data, explore the data, create visualizations, build machine learning models, and get insights from both exploration and models.

## Status:
Work in progress â€” updates will be added as more models and visualizations are completed.

Key Goals:

* Classify whether a future Pokemon is Legendary
* Predict total base stats for future Pokemon
* Discover patterns in Pokemon using distinct base stats.

Packages Used:
Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Plotly

Repository Contents:

* Contains data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning experiments
* Plots and visualizations
* Insights, observations, and discoveries

Note:
Feel free to browse  the project even if it is a work in progress. The project will be updated periodically with new models and analyses.

## Models finished:

Here are the list of the machine learning models that are completed for this project.

Each Model contains:
- A explenation of how the model works.
- The code of the model.
- Insights or results. (Some models such as KNN or PCA contain visuals.)
