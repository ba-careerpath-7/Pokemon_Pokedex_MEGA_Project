# Pokemon_Pokedex_MEGA_Project


### Pokemon Pokedex MEGA Project from Resume

READ ME: To view the project, press: Pokemon_Pokedex_MEGA_Project_(main).ipynb


## Overview:
This MEGA Project explores Pokemon data using Python, data science, and machine learning. The goal is to clean the Pokedex data, explore the data, create visualizations, build machine learning models, and get insights from both exploration and models.

Key Goals:

* Classify whether a future Pokemon is Legendary
* Predict total base stats for future Pokemon
* Discover patterns in Pokemon using distinct base stats.

Coding Language Used: Python

Python Packages Used:
NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras, Plotly, YellowBrick, Scipy 

Repository Contents:

* Contains data cleaning, filtering, aggregates, EDA, and machine learning experiments
* Plots and visualizations
* Insights, observations, and discoveries


## Models finished:

Here are the list of the machine learning models that are completed, as well as those planned for implementation for this project.

Each Model contains:
- A explanation of how the model works.
- The code of the model.
